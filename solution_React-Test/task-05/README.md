### 5. [Use React Context](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/how-to-use-react-context-effectively)

Before you start coding make sure to:

- Navigate to the directory `task-05` in your terminal
- Run `npm i` or `npm install`

You should create **two** state variables in the parent `<App />`:

- `name`
- `location`

You should then create three child components:

- one which renders a `div` to display the name
- one which renders a `div` to display the location
- one which renders two `inputs` you can use to update the state variables in the parent

Finally, you should use React **context** in the parent to pass ("provide") data to the child components, so they all work as expected.

**Note:** You do not need to worry about styling your solution!
