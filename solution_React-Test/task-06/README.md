### 6. [Move a Box Up](https://malcoded.com/posts/react-component-style/)

Before you start coding make sure to:

- Navigate to the directory `task-06` in your terminal
- Run `npm i` or `npm install`

This challenge requires you to move the position of a provided box upwards whenever you **click** the button `Move Up`.

The tasks in this challenge are:

- Create a state variable to hold a number value.
- Use inline CSS to link the position of the box on the page to the state variable.
- Handle an event which increments or decrements the state variable to change the position of the box on the page.

**Note:** You do not need to worry about making your solution look exactly the same as below, as long as the box moves upwards when you click the button. :-)
